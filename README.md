# pdisk: a Macintosh hard disk partition tool for UNIX.

pdisk is a UNIX tool to create/manipulate classic Macintosh hard disk partitions.

pdisk was originally written by Apple Computer, with modifications by Eryk Vershen <eryk@cfcl.com>

This version of pdisk was forked from the Apple github repository, lightly reworked to compile on contemporary Linux and FreeBSD.
